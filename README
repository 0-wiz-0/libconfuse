This is libConfuse, a library for parsing configuration files. It was
called libcfg before, but was changed to not confuse with other
similar libraries.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions. By default, only a
static library is built. Specify --enable-shared to the configure
script to also build a shared library.

Documentation can be built by running doxygen in the top-level
directory. It is also available at
http://www.e.kth.se/~e97_mhe/confuse-manual/index.shtml.

There is a project page at http://sv.nongnu.org/projects/confuse.
