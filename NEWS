New in 1.2.4
------------

* Added _WIN32 #if's, should compile on Windows (not tested)
* Changed cfg_flag_t from enum to int (should now compile with c++)
* Variable number of arguments to functions: function types should no
  longer specify number of expected arguments in the initializer, the
  callback should instead check the argc variable. NOTE! compatibility
  with earlier versions is broken.
* Fixed the cfg_tilde_expand function
* Addedd documentation for the value parsing callback
* Changed the definitions of cfg_func_t and cfg_callback_t, the cfg
  and opt context are now both passed as parameters
  NOTE! This will break compatibility with earlier versions, you'll
  have to change your callback declarations.
* The default value in the initializer macros is now a string, which
  is parsed in the same way as the configuration file. NOTE! this
  breaks compatibility with earlier versions! It is now possible
  to initialize default values for lists, as well as not having a
  default value at all.
* Fixed and extended the example programs
* Added cfg_setXXX functions to set option values
* Added cfg_output function that writes a configuration file based on
  the options and values


New in 1.2.3
------------

* fixed segfault due to uninitialized user-defined error function
* added callback support

* Doesn't build shared libraries by default (only static)
* More swedish translations
* Implemented the cfg_free() function (previous versions had only a stub)
* New function: cfg_free_val()
* updated the manual
