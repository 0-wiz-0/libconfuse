New in 2.1
----------

* Reversed logic in cfg_getXXX functions, they now abort if given an
  undeclared option name, and NULL/false if no value is set. Suggested
  by Ademar de Souza Reis Jr.
* Sections without CFGF_MULTI flag now have default values
* The cfg_getXXX functions now accept an extended syntax for the
  option name, try cfg_getxxx(cfg, "sectionname|optionname"). This way
  one doesn't have to first get the section with cfg_getsec().
* Fixed two more memory leaks. (val->section and cfg->filename)
* Added project files for MS Visual C++ 6.0
* Includes io.h on windows
* Fixed initialization of default values for lists, when given a NULL
  string. Now initialized to the empty list. Noted by Juraj Variny.
* Setting a list to the empty list in the config file now possible.
* Appending to default values in a list is now ok.



New in 2.0
----------

 NOTE! Compatibility with earlier versions is broken.

* Changed cfg_flag_t from enum to int (should now compile with c++)
* Variable number of arguments to functions: function types should no
  longer specify number of expected arguments in the initializer, the
  callback should instead check the argc variable.
* Fixed the cfg_tilde_expand function
* Added documentation for the value parsing callback
* Changed the definitions of cfg_func_t and cfg_callback_t, the cfg
  and option context are now both passed as parameters
* Fixed and extended the example programs
* Added a bunch of cfg_setXXX functions to set option values after parsing
* Some types renamed for consistency (cfgopt_t to cfg_opt_t, cfgval_t
  to cfg_value_t, cfgbool_t to cfg_bool_t)
* cfg_free_val() renamed to cfg_free_value()
* Lexer symbols now uses prefix cfg_ to ease linking with other lexers
* Forgot to close the file in cfg_parse()
* Memory leaks fixed (checked with valgrind)
* Sections with same title are always overwritten
* Lists can now have (complete) default values in the form of a string
  that is parsed in the same way as the config file (see doc + examples)
* Added support for building as a DLL on Windows
* Included project files for Borland C++ Builder 6.0
* Included project files for Dev-Cpp 5.0
* Included project files for MS Visual Studio
* Pre-built documentation now included in the source tarball


New in 1.2.3
------------

* fixed segfault due to uninitialized user-defined error function
* added callback support


New in 1.2.2
------------

* changed name to libConfuse (libcfg was way too common)
* Doesn't build shared libraries by default (only static)
* More swedish translations
* Implemented the cfg_free() function (previous versions had only a stub)
* New function: cfg_free_val()
* updated the manual
